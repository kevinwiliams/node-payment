        <p>We take every precaution to protect your personal information.  When we ask you to submit financial information, such as your credit card  number, we use industry standard technology for secure commerce transactions.  It encrypts data, including your credit card number. Most banks or credit card  providers either cover all charges resulting from unauthorized use of your  credit card or limit your liability to a maximum amount. Refer to your credit  card agreement to check your coverage for liability. You are also advised to  check your coverage for liability for unauthorized use of other cards such as  debit cards.</p>
        <p>In addition, we have strict security protocols in place to protect our customer  database, and only allow access to it when absolutely necessary, and then under  strict guidelines as to what use may be made of such details. </p>
