            <h2>Information Collection</h2>
            <p>
                At the Jamaica Observer Limited we collect different types of information about our users for three main reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>To help us to improve the services we offer.</li>
                <li>To provide personalized services unique to individual users.</li>
                <li>To use anonymous details about our users to sell appropriate advertising space on the site. This might mean showing an advertiser how many users we have on the site; it does not mean sharing an individual's details with an advertiser. Where we collect registration information from an individual, we will never share that individual's information with a third party, including an advertiser, without that user's explicit permission.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>FAQS</h2>
            <h3 class="py-3">What information do we collect?</h3>
            <p>
                We collect information on our users in two ways: through cookies, and through registration. For more information about cookies, please see our Terms and Conditions. The minimum information we need to register a user is an email address and a password. We will ask further questions for different services, including competitions and subscription based services. Unless stated, all registration questions are compulsory. We also ask some further, voluntary questions so we can gain a clearer understanding of our users. Your responses help us to sell appropriate advertising space and so keep the site free. They also enable us to personalize services for our users. We do not share this information with third parties unless you have specifically consented to this. We also collect data listing which of our pages are most frequently visited and by which types of users.
